                Born and raised in New Delhi, Kohli trained at the West Delhi Cricket Academy and started his youth
                career with the Delhi Under-15 team. He made his international debut in 2008 and quickly became a key
                player in the ODI team and later made his Test debut in 2011. In 2013, Kohli reached the number one spot
                in the ICC rankings for ODI batsmen for the first time. During 2014 T20 World Cup, he set a record for
                the most runs scored in the tournament. In 2018, he achieved yet another milestone, becoming the world's
                top-ranked Test batsman, making him the only Indian cricketer to hold the number one spot in all three
                formats of the game. His form continued in 2019, when he became the first player to score 20,000
                international runs in a single decade. In 2021, Kohli made the decision to step down as the captain of
                the Indian national team for T20Is, following the T20 World Cup and in early 2022 he stepped down as the
                captain of the Test team as well.
                <br><br>
                He has received many accolades for his performances on the cricket field. He was recognized as the ICC
                ODI Player of the Year in 2012 and has won the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy, given to the ICC Cricketer of
                the Year, on two occasions, in 2017 and 2018 respectively. Subsequently, Kohli also won ICC Test Player
                of the Year and ICC ODI Player of the Year awards in 2018, becoming the first player to win both awards
                in the same year. Additionally, he was named the Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World for three
                consecutive years, from 2016 to 2018. At the national level, Kohli was honoured with the Arjuna Award in
                2013, the Padma Shri under the sports category in 2017 and the Khel Ratna award, India's highest
                sporting honour, in 2018.
